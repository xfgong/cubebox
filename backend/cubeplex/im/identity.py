"""Sender identity resolution + workspace-member gate.

Maps an IM sender onto the cubeplex user that should drive the run, gated
by workspace membership. The mapping is cached in ``im_identity_links``
so steady-state we don't hit external APIs on every inbound.

Resolution order:
1. Cache hit in ``im_identity_links`` (by account_id + im_user_id).
2. Platform-specific email resolution (e.g. Feishu contact API).
3. ``/link`` command fallback — platforms without email APIs (Discord)
   use ``NullIdentityResolver`` which always returns None, forcing
   users to link manually via ``/link <email>``.
