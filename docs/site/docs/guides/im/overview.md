# IM Connectors

IM connectors let your workspace's agent answer messages inside a chat platform — Feishu/Lark, DingTalk, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, or WeCom. You bind a bot once, and from then on anyone in the chat (who is also a member of your workspace) can @-mention the bot or DM it and get the same agent that runs in the CubePlex web app, with the same skills, memory, and tools.

## The general model

Every platform follows the same four-step flow:

1. **Bind a bot.** A workspace member registers the bot's credentials (app ID, secrets, tokens) against the workspace. CubePlex stores them encrypted and creates an **IM connector account**.
2. **Inbound message arrives.** The platform delivers each message to CubePlex — either by pushing it to a webhook URL you configure in the platform's console, or over a persistent socket CubePlex opens to the platform (see [Delivery modes](#delivery-modes)).
3. **Identity gate + agent run.** CubePlex figures out _which CubePlex user_ the sender is (see [Identity linking](#identity-linking)), confirms they belong to the workspace, then starts an agent run on their behalf.
4. **Reply.** The agent's response streams back into the chat. On Feishu it renders as a live-updating interactive card; on other platforms it posts as a message (and edits in place where the platform allows). Files the agent shows you (`present_file`) or saves as downloadable deliverables (`save_artifact`) are sent as native image or file messages on Feishu, Slack, and Discord when the run finishes. Interactive websites still arrive as a share link.

The bot runs each message as a real CubePlex user, so permissions, model access, and tool access are exactly what that user would have in the web app. If a sender can't be matched to a workspace member, the bot replies that it can't help and the run never starts.

## Supported platforms

CubePlex ships connector code for six platforms. They are **not** equally mature — Feishu/Lark is the reference implementation — but each has its own setup guide.

| Platform            | Maturity                                                                                                                                         | Delivery mode                        | Setup guide                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Feishu / Lark**   | Most developed — interactive streaming cards, message encryption, signature verification, in-place card edits, human-in-the-loop button actions. | Long-connection (default) or webhook | [Feishu / Lark](./feishu.md)  |
| **Slack**           | Working connector — in-place message edits, automatic email-based identity resolution, native `/link` / `/new` / `/reset` slash commands.        | Gateway (Socket Mode)                | [Slack](./slack.md)           |
| **DingTalk**        | Working connector — automatic email-based identity resolution; text `/new` / `/reset` / `link`.                                                  | Stream                               | [DingTalk](./dingtalk.md)     |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Working connector — validates the Azure Bot Framework JWT on each inbound activity; requires a publicly reachable host.                          | Webhook                              | [Microsoft Teams](./teams.md) |
| **Discord**         | Working connector — native `/new`, `/reset`, `/link` slash commands.                                                                             | Gateway                              | [Discord](./discord.md)       |
| **WeCom**           | Working AI Bot connector — cumulative streaming replies and manual identity linking.                                                             | Stream (WebSocket)                   | [WeCom](./wecom.md)           |

Command support varies by platform — see [Conversation commands](#conversation-commands).

### Delivery modes

How a platform's messages reach CubePlex depends on the platform:

- **Long-connection / gateway / stream** — CubePlex opens a persistent outbound socket to the platform and receives events over it. Nothing needs to be reachable from the internet, so this works behind a firewall. Feishu (default), Slack, Discord, DingTalk, and WeCom use this style.
- **Webhook** — the platform POSTs each event to a public URL on your CubePlex host. The host must be reachable from the platform's servers. Feishu (optional) and Teams use this style.

:::note Re-enabling a connection account
Disabling or deleting an account tears down its live connection immediately. Re-enabling a long-connection, gateway, or stream account establishes a new connection without restarting the API.
:::

## Identity linking

A message in a chat app carries a platform user ID, not a CubePlex identity. Before running anything, CubePlex maps the sender to a CubePlex user and checks they're a member of the bot's workspace. Membership is **re-checked on every message**, even after the mapping is cached — a user removed from the workspace stops getting answers immediately.

Resolution happens in this order:

1. **Cached link.** If the sender was matched before, CubePlex reuses the stored mapping (after re-confirming workspace membership).
2. **Email resolution.** On platforms with a contact API — **Feishu, Slack, and DingTalk** — CubePlex looks up the sender's email and matches it to a CubePlex user with that email.
3. **`/link` command fallback.** On platforms without an email API (**Discord**, **Teams**, **WeCom**), or whenever email resolution fails, the sender links manually.

### Linking with `/link`

The sender sends the bot:

```
/link you@example.com
```

(The Chinese alias `绑定 you@example.com` also works.) The bot replies with a confirmation URL of the form `https://<your-cubeplex-host>/im-link?token=...`. The link carries a short-lived signed token (valid 10 minutes) encoding the claimed email and the target workspace.

The sender opens that link **while logged in to CubePlex**. CubePlex confirms that the logged-in user's email matches the claimed email and that they belong to the workspace, then permanently links the chat identity to the CubePlex account. After that, the sender's messages run as that user without re-linking.

:::tip
The email you `/link` must be the email of an existing CubePlex account that is already a member of the bot's workspace. Linking does not create accounts or grant membership — it only connects an existing one.

## Conversation commands

Command support differs by platform — not every command exists everywhere.

| Command                           | Effect                                                                                                                                           | Available on                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/link <email>`                   | Links your chat identity to your CubePlex account (see [Identity linking](#identity-linking)).                                                   | All platforms. Native slash command on Slack and Discord; a text message on Feishu, DingTalk, Teams, and WeCom. The Chinese alias `绑定 <email>` works on Feishu only.                                                               |
| `/new` (alias `/reset`, `新对话`) | Starts a fresh conversation — drops the current conversation binding for the chat scope you're in, so the bot starts clean on your next message. | All platforms. Native slash command on Discord and Slack; a text message on Feishu, DingTalk, Teams, and WeCom (and as a plain `@bot /new` message on Slack). The Chinese alias `新对话` works everywhere the text form is accepted. |

:::note Slack slash commands and threads
Custom slash commands on Slack **cannot run inside message threads** (Slack platform limit). Use a plain `@bot /new` / `@bot 新对话` message in the thread, or run `/link` from a DM or the channel main timeline. Details: [Slack setup → Conversation commands](./slack.md#conversation-commands).
:::

See each platform's setup guide for the exact command form.

## Channel binding modes

In a group chat, you can choose whether everyone shares one conversation or each person gets their own:

- **Isolated** (default) — each sender in a group gets their own private conversation with the bot. This is the default for any channel without an explicit binding.
- **Shared** — everyone in the channel talks to one shared conversation. Shared mode requires choosing a sandbox mode for the channel.

Bindings are managed per account from the workspace IM settings.

## Managing connectors

IM connector accounts are created and managed from your workspace settings. Workspace members can connect a bot that runs **as themselves**; binding a bot that runs as _another_ user (impersonation) requires the **workspace admin** role. Disabling, deleting, and channel-binding management are available from the same settings area.

## Per-platform setup guides

Every platform binds through the same workspace IM settings and follows the same inbound → identity gate → agent run → reply model described above. The credentials and console steps differ — follow the guide for your platform:

- **[Feishu / Lark](./feishu.md)** — app ID + app secret (+ optional encrypt key / verification token). Long-connection (default) or webhook.
- **[Slack](./slack.md)** — bot token + app-level token (Socket Mode). Gateway.
- **[DingTalk](./dingtalk.md)** — app key + app secret. Stream.
- **[Microsoft Teams](./teams.md)** — app (bot) ID + app secret + tenant ID. Webhook (needs a publicly reachable host).
- **[Discord](./discord.md)** — bot token + application ID. Gateway; native `/new`, `/reset`, `/link` slash commands.
- **[WeCom](./wecom.md)** — AI Bot ID + Secret. Outbound WebSocket stream; manual `/link` identity setup.
