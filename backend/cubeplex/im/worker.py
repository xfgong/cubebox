"""Durable IM run-queue worker.

Polls the ``im_run_queue`` table, claims pending or stale-leased rows via
``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``, calls ``RunManager.start_run`` with a
``RunContext`` derived from the account, then flips the receipt to
``completed`` and fires the ``on_run_started`` hook so the app can spawn
an outbound tailer for the run.

Crash safety: if ``start_run`` raises, the row stays in ``status='started'``
but with a finite ``claim_lease_expires_at``. After the lease expires, the
next worker poll re-claims via the lease branch in
``claim_pending_queue_item``. ``max_attempts`` caps the spin so a
permanently-broken event eventually parks (a janitor pass beyond v1 will
flip such rows to ``status='failed'``).
