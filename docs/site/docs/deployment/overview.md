# Deployment Overview

CubePlex can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. Both deployment
modes below run the **same backend and frontend container images** — only
the orchestration differs.

## Choose a deployment target

| | Docker Compose | Kubernetes (Helm) |
|---|---|---|
| Best for | A single host — quick self-hosted setup, small teams, internal demos | Multi-node clusters, production-scale, autoscaling |
| Orchestration | `docker compose up -d` | `helm upgrade --install` |
| Infra included | Postgres, Redis, rustfs, OpenSandbox | Postgres, Redis, rustfs, and the alibaba OpenSandbox umbrella |
| Guide | [Docker Compose install guide](./docker-compose.md) | [Kubernetes install guide](./kubernetes.md) |

If you're not sure, start with Docker Compose — it's the simpler setup and
covers everything except horizontal scaling across multiple machines.

## Agent sandbox

CubePlex runs agent tool calls (bash, file read/write, …) inside an
[OpenSandbox](https://github.com/alibaba/OpenSandbox) sandbox. It is a required
part of every deployment: Docker Compose includes the service, and Helm bundles
it by default. Helm may instead point at an externally managed OpenSandbox
endpoint, but a backend always requires a non-empty endpoint, sandbox image,
and API key. Sandbox images default to Docker Hub (`opensandbox/*`) and GHCR
(`ghcr.io/cubeplexai/cubeplex-sandbox`); mainland-China mirrors are noted inline
in each guide.

## LLM provider configuration

Both deployment modes configure LLM providers the same way, as a block under
`llm` in the backend's secret configuration. This reference applies whether
you're editing `config.production.secrets.yaml` (Docker Compose) or
`values.local.yaml` (Kubernetes) — each guide links back here instead of
repeating it.

The most portable way to configure a provider is to point at any
**OpenAI-compatible** (`api: openai-completions`) or **Anthropic-compatible**
(`api: anthropic-messages`) endpoint. This covers OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure
OpenAI, most cloud vendors, and self-hosted gateways (vLLM, LiteLLM, Ollama,
…) — you supply `base_url`, `api_key`, and the models the endpoint exposes.

```yaml
llm:
  # A default preset is REQUIRED. The backend seeds it from model_presets at
  # startup and resolves every chat message through it — without one the backend
  # still boots but chat fails at runtime with NoDefaultPresetError (HTTP 500).
  # Each tier's primary / fallbacks is "<provider_name>/<model_id>"; the
  # provider_name must appear under providers below.
  model_presets:
    tiers:
      lite:  { enabled: true,  primary: "openai/gpt-5.6-terra", fallbacks: ["anthropic/claude-opus-4.8"] }
      flash: { enabled: true,  primary: "openai/gpt-5.6-terra", fallbacks: ["anthropic/claude-opus-4.8"] }
      pro:   { enabled: true,  primary: "openai/gpt-5.6-terra", fallbacks: ["anthropic/claude-opus-4.8"] }
      max:   { enabled: false, primary: null, fallbacks: [] }
    default_preset: pro
  providers:
    # Any OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint.
    openai:
      base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"   # includes /v1
      api_key: "sk-..."
      api: "openai-completions"
      models:
        - id: "gpt-5.6-terra"
          name: "GPT-5.6 Terra"
          input: ["text", "image"]
          context_window: 128000
          max_tokens: 16384

    # Any Anthropic-compatible Messages endpoint.
    anthropic:
      base_url: "https://api.anthropic.com"   # host root, no /v1
      api_key: "sk-ant-..."
      api: "anthropic-messages"
      models:
        - id: "claude-opus-4.8"
          name: "Claude Opus 4.8"
          reasoning: true
          input: ["text", "image"]
          context_window: 200000
          max_tokens: 64000
```

- `model_presets.tiers` defines the selectable model tiers (`lite` / `flash` /
  `pro` / `max`); `default_preset` picks which tier serves requests that don't
  ask for a specific one. At least one tier must be enabled. Each `primary` /
  `fallbacks` entry is `"<provider_name>/<model_id>"`; the `provider_name` must
  appear under `providers`, and fallbacks are tried in order if `primary` fails.
  Tiers you don't need can stay `enabled: false`.
- Each provider declares `base_url`, `api_key`, `api`
  (`openai-completions` | `anthropic-messages` | `openai-responses`), and at
  least one entry in `models`. `base_url` follows each SDK's convention —
  OpenAI-style includes `/v1`, Anthropic-style is the host root.
- Set `reasoning: true` only for reasoning models; `input` lists the
  modalities the model accepts (`text`, `image`).

Minimal viable configuration (one provider, one model):

```yaml
llm:
  model_presets:
    tiers:
      pro: { enabled: true, primary: "openai/gpt-5.6-terra", fallbacks: [] }
    default_preset: pro
  providers:
    openai:
      base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
      api_key: "sk-..."
      api: "openai-completions"
      models:
        - id: "gpt-5.6-terra"
          name: "GPT-5.6 Terra"
          input: ["text", "image"]
          context_window: 128000
          max_tokens: 16384
```

### Shortcut: built-in vendor presets

For a known vendor you can skip `base_url` / `api` / `models` and reference a
built-in `preset` instead — it fills in the endpoint and model list for you:

```yaml
llm:
  model_presets:
    tiers:
      pro: { enabled: true, primary: "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash", fallbacks: [] }
    default_preset: pro
  providers:
    deepseek:
      preset: "deepseek/cn/anthropic-messages"
      api_key: "sk-..."
```

Preset keys are `vendor/region/protocol[/plan]` and live in
`backend/cubeplex/llm/catalog/data/vendors.yaml` (deepseek / aliyun /
volcengine / moonshot / zhipu / minimax / openrouter / anthropic / openai, and
more).

## Required secrets

Every deployment needs three auth secrets, regardless of mode:

| Secret | Purpose | Generate with |
|---|---|---|
| `jwt_secret` | Signs and verifies user session JWTs | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `csrf_secret` | CSRF double-submit cookie | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `vault_key` | Fernet key encrypting the MCP / credentials vault | `python -c 'from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())'` |

All three are required. The backend refuses to start outside tests if either
signing secret is empty, fewer than 32 characters, or a known placeholder such
as `REPLACE_ME`, `USE ENV`, or `CHANGE_ME…`. Helm also rejects those
placeholders during installation.

## Upgrading artifact object keys

Releases that switch artifact storage from
`artifacts/{conversation_id}/{artifact_id}/...` to
`artifacts/{artifact_id}/...` keep reading the owner-conversation legacy key
while migration is in progress. Use this rollout order:

1. Deploy the new backend so both canonical and legacy reads are available.
2. Run `python scripts/dev/migrate_artifact_object_keys.py` inside a backend
   container. The command is idempotent and retains legacy objects by default.
3. Verify artifact download, preview, sharing, and skill publication.
4. Optionally rerun the command with `--delete-source` to remove copied legacy
   objects.

Objects historically written below a conversation other than the artifact's
owner are not discovered automatically and require manual recovery.
